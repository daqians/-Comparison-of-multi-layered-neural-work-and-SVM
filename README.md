# -Comparison-of-multi-layered-neural-work-and-SVM
It is aimed to accomplish the last suggested project – ‘Implement and train a multi-layered neural network, evolving the weights using the diﬀerence between expected and actual outputs as a ﬁtness function. Then compare its properties, such as accuracy or speed, to an SVM.’ We constructed a neural network implemented in Python and then compared it with a SVM classifier developed in MATLAB for the aspects of accuracy and training time, on three kinds of datasets – ‘attribute-fixed’, ‘semi-attribute-fixed’, and ‘attribute-floating’.
